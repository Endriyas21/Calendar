## Project Initialization

This project was initiated with Create React App, a popular toolchain for building React applications.

## Scripts You Can Use

In the project directory, you have access to several commands:

- `yarn start`: This command fires up the app in development mode. Visit http://localhost:3000 to see it in your browser. The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code. You'll also see any lint errors in the console.

- `yarn test`: This command launches the test runner in an interactive watch mode. For more details, check out the section about running tests.

- `yarn build`: This command builds the app for production to the build folder. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is now ready to conquer the world!
